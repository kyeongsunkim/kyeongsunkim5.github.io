\begin{itemize}
\item
  A single degree-of-freedom system loaded by ambient white noise was
  investigated by statistical assessment of dynamic modal parameters
  such as natural frequency and damping factors of Offshore Wind
  Turbine(OWT).
\item
  The UNISON's U4 (4MW) OWT system of was simulated using advanced
  Finite Element modelling considering soil-structure interaction was
  validated and updated using a series of centrifuge experiments, which
  can account for the influence of soil's confining pressure and
  blade-rotor-nacelle assembly and tower's mass scale effects.
\item
  Using state-of-art statistical techniques such as correlation
  functions estimated by both Random Decrement Analysis (RDA) and
  Perturbation Wavelet Analysis (PWA) and Chi-squared Hypothesis Tests
  as a basis for system parameter identification, the OWT system was
  assessed by a threshold estimation procedure, developed with machine
  learning model fed with scour-damaged response data correlated with
  foundation's ULS, SLS, and FLS performances.
\item
  The model's accuracy was further enhanced by supervised learning from
  large amount of virtual data produced by the updated FEM model to be
  able to predict for a long term (20 years) Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
  or to classify Scour Health Index based on current system parameters.
\item
  The outcome of the study will lead to improved timing of maintenance
  and reduced offshore investigation and maintenance jobs, resulting in
  reduced risk of failure for the OWT. The system's dynamic property
  parameters can be monitored to ensure its safe operation.

To model natural frequency, solid element can be converted to beam
elements, Boundary conditions can be applied as linear springs of soil
stiffness. Interface properties are not needed.

For 3D modelling, only foundation can be modelled for application of
static load. From load-displacement response, stiffness can be obtained,
which can be used for calculation of natural frequency.

We must select important influence factors for natural frequency:
\(f_n = \sqrt{\frac{K}{M}}\).

Vesic (1961) provided a relationship between the modulus of subgrade
reaction \(K\), used in the Winkler spring problem and the material
properties in the elastic continuum problem as

\[
K = \frac{0.65 E_s}{(1-\mu^2_s)} \big( \frac{E_s D^4}{E_p I_p} \big)^{1/12}
\] where \(E_s=\) soil modulus of elasticity;\(\mu_s=\) Poisson's ratio
of soil; \(D=\) diameter; and \(E_p I_p\) flexural rigidity of pile.

For circular footing embedded in stratum over bedrock, static stiffness
of soil (DNV-OS-J101-2014 Table G-2) is given by: \[
K_V = \frac{4GR}{1-\nu} (1+ 1.28 \frac{R}{H}) (1+ \frac{D}{2R}) (1+ (0.85  -0.28 \frac{D}{R})\frac{\frac{D}{H}}{1-\frac{D}{G}})
\]

\(K_{soil}\) depends on the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  embedment depth \(\frac{D}{B}\)
\item
  depth to bedrock \(H\)
\item
  Elastic properties \(G, \nu\)
\item
  density of soil \(\rho\)
\item
  tower's flexural rigidity \(EI\)
\end{itemize}

Check: - relationship between axial, horizontal, and rotational
stiffness

\hypertarget{answer-2}{%
\subsection{Answer 2}\label{answer-2}}

As a researcher in Geotechnical Engineering, to measure natural
frequency from ambient vibrations of real structures, one can follow the
following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Data Collection: Collect the acceleration data from the structure
  during ambient vibration conditions, such as during wind or traffic
  load. This data can be collected using sensors such as accelerometers
  attached to the structure.
\item
  Signal Processing: The collected acceleration data must be processed
  to remove any noise and to extract the meaningful signals. This can be
  done through techniques such as filtering and spectral analysis.
\item
  Modal Analysis: Modal analysis can be performed to extract the natural
  frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios of the structure. The
  extracted modes can be used to estimate the natural frequencies of the
  structure.
\item
  Comparison with Numerical Models: The natural frequencies obtained
  from the modal analysis can be compared with the results from
  numerical models of the structure. This can help to verify the
  accuracy of the modal analysis and also to confirm the similarity
  between the response of the real structure and the numerical model.
\item
  Validation through Field Tests: Finally, the results obtained from
  modal analysis and numerical models can be validated through
  additional field tests such as forced vibration tests or ambient
  vibration tests. This can provide additional confidence in the results
  and also help to identify any discrepancies or limitations in the
  modal analysis techniques.

Monopiles and gravity base foundations (GBF) are two of the most
commonly used foundations for offshore wind turbines. As resonance can
cause damage and even failure of wind turbines, understanding the
difference between the dynamic responses of monopiles and GBFs under
free vibration is important. However there is little experimental data
regarding their natural frequency, especially from model tests carried
out at correct stress levels. This paper presents the results of novel
monopile and GBF tests using a centrifuge to directly determine the
natural frequency (fn) of the foundation-soil system. The natural
frequencies of wind turbine monopiles and GBFs in centrifuge models were
measured during harmonic loading using a piezo-actuator, with the
results confirming that soil-structure interaction must be considered to
obtain the system's natural frequency as this frequency reduces
substantially from fixed-base values. These results will contribute in
preventing resonance induced damage in wind-turbines

\subsection{Assessment of bridge natural frequency as an indicator of
scour using centrifuge
modelling}\label{assessment-of-bridge-natural-frequency-as-an-indicator-of-scour-using-centrifuge-modelling}}

One of the most prevalent causes of bridge failure around the world is
``scour''---the gradual erosion of soil around a bridge foundation due
to fast-flowing water. A reliable technique for monitoring scour would
help bridge engineers take timely countermeasures to safeguard against
failure. Although vibration-based techniques for monitoring structural
damage have had limited success, primarily due to insufficient
sensitivity, these have tended to focus on the detection of local
damage. High natural frequency sensitivity has recently been reported
for scour damage. Previous experiments to investigate this have been
limited as a result of the cost of full-scale testing and the fact that
scaled-down soil-structure models tested outside a centrifuge do not
adequately simulate full-scale behaviour. This paper describes the
development of what is believed to be the first-ever centrifuge-testing
programme to establish the sensitivity of bridge natural frequency to
scour. A 1/60 scale model of a two-span integral bridge with 15~m spans
was tested at varying levels of scour. For the fundamental mode of
vibration, these tests found up to a 40\% variation in natural frequency
for 30\% loss of embedment. Models of three other types of foundation,
which represent a shallow pad foundation, a deep pile bent and a deep
monopile, were also tested in the centrifuge at different scour levels.
The shallow foundation model showed lower frequency sensitivity to scour
than the deep foundation models. Another important finding is that the
frequency sensitivity to ``global scour'' is slightly higher than the
sensitivity to ``local scour'', for all foundation types. The level of
frequency sensitivity (3.1--44\% per scour depth equivalent to 30\% of
embedment of scour) detected in this experiment demonstrates the
potential for using natural frequency as an indicator of both local and
global scour of bridges, particularly those with deep foundations.

\subsection{Dynamic response of monopiles in sand using centrifuge
modelling}\label{dynamic-response-of-monopiles-in-sand-using-centrifuge-modelling}}

Monopiles are one of the most commonly used offshore foundation for wind
turbines. Their static capacity, p-y curve and cyclic loading behaviour
have been studied using 1 g tests and centrifuge tests, but there is
little experimental data regarding their natural frequency, especially
using centrifuge testing. The design of offshore wind turbine
foundations is largely governed by natural frequency as resonance due to
cyclic loading can cause damage and even failure. Understanding the
dynamic response of the monopile under free vibration is thus critical
to design. This paper presents the results of novel monopile (large
diameter) and single pile (small diameter) tests in a centrifuge to for
the first time directly determine the natural frequency (fn) of the
pile-soil system. An experimental methodology was used to define the
natural frequency via measured acceleration and force time histories and
their fast Fourier transforms (FFT) under a force applied at a
controlled frequency. The effects of pile diameter, embedded length,
free length of the tower and soil density on fn were investigated in the
centrifuge tests. The same models used in the centrifuge test at 50 g
were also tested at 1 g in order to assess the relevance of earlier 1 g
investigations into system behaviour. The measured natural frequency of
wind turbine monopiles in centrifuge models during harmonic loading from
a piezo-actuator, confirmed that soil structure interaction at an
appropriate stress level must be taken into account to obtain the
correct natural frequency. The experimental data was compared to
theoretical solutions, giving important insights into the behaviour of
these systems.

In this study, the cyclic responses of an offshore wind turbine with a
tripod foundation installed on an actual site were evaluated in a
centrifuge. To understand the behavior of the turbine at the site, the
site soil conditions, environmental loads, and real offshore wind
turbine structure installed at the actual site were modeled by
considering the centrifuge scaling law. From a series of cyclic loading
tests, the cyclic responses of the tripod foundation were evaluated in
terms of temporary/permanent displacements and cyclic stiffness.
Moreover, the long-term behavior of the tripod foundation was predicted
from the experimental results. The test results showed that the initial
stiffness of the soil--foundation system decreased as the loading
amplitude increased and that the stiffness increased with the number of
cycles due to soil densification. The findings revealed that the cyclic
behaviors of the tripod were more affected by the load amplitude than
the number of cycles. In addition, the permanent rotation increased
logarithmically with the number of cycles. A simple method to predict
the displacement and change in the foundation stiffness of the actual
wind turbine is proposed based on the results of the model tests. The
results of this study also provide key insights into the long-term
cyclic behavior of tripod foundations for offshore wind turbines.

A simplified scour model for tripod foundation taking into account both

incorporated into a three-dimensional (3D) finite element model for
analysis of a full-scale offshore wind turbine founded on a tripod

different scour conditions under two wave situations are examined for
the ultimate limit state (ULS), serviceability limit state (SLS) and
fatigue limit state (FLS). The results show that scour has a minor
effect on the natural frequency of the tripod-supported wind turbine but
can significantly increase the maximum cross-sectional von Mises stress
of piles under the ULS and increase the deflection of piles within
nearly 20 m below the original seabed under the SLS. As for the fatigue
life of the tripod structure, it can also be reduced by the effect of
scour. These findings provide insights which are useful for development

Foundation scour can have a detrimental effect on the performance of
bridge piers, inducing a signiﬁcant reduction of the lateral capacity of
the footing and accumulation of permanent settlement and rotation.
Although the hydraulic processes responsible for foundation scour are
nowadays well known, predicting their mechanical consequences is still
challenging. Indeed, its impact on the failure mechanisms developing
around the foundation has not been fully investigated. In this paper,
numerical simulations are performed to study the vertical and lateral
response of a scoured bridge pier founded on a cylindrical caisson
foundation embedded in a layer of dense sand. The sand stress--strain
behaviour is reproduced by employing the Severn-Trent model. The
constitutive model is ﬁrstly calibrated on a set of soil element tests,
including drained and undrained monotonic triaxial tests and resonant
column tests. The calibration procedure is implemented considering the
stress and strain nonuniformities within the samples, by simulating the
laboratory tests as boundary value problems. The numerical model is then
validated against the results of centrifuge tests. The results of the
simulations are in good agreement with the experimental results in terms
of foundation capacity and settlement accumulation. Moreover, the model
can predict the effects of local and general scour. The numerical
analyses also highlight the impact of scouring on the failure
mechanisms, revealing that the soil resistance depends on the hydraulic
scenario.

This study presents a simplified analysis technique capable of
predicting the dynamic behavior of a tripod suction pile subjected to a
horizontal load. The first natural frequency of the system, horizontal
displacement, and allowable rotation angle at the pile head were set as
target physical quantities in accordance with substructure design
requirements. In consideration of the physical characteristics of the
tripod suction pile, the analysis was extended to the single
pile-multi-pile-tripod-tower part to derive the influence factors. A
possible displacement response function that could be applied to the
intermediate pile range was also proposed. Thereafter, a detailed design
was determined using an integrated load analysis, which included a
turbine based on the basic design of simplified analysis method.
Furthermore, the dynamic behavior of the offshore wind turbine at each
installation stage was predicted using a numerical analysis and measured
via field tests. The displacement at the pile head and the predicted
value of the first natural frequency of the system were compared using
the field-measured and numerical analysis values. The first natural
frequency value produced by the simple analysis method showed an error
range within 1\%, and the displacement at the pile head also satisfied
the structural design requirements. Therefore, this method provides a
quick and accurate solution to the lateral response of tripod suction
piles as foundations for offshore wind turbines

The scale of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) has increased in order to
enhance their energy generation. However, strong aero/hydrodynamic loads
can degrade the dynamic characteristics of OWTs because they are
installed on soft seabeds. This degradation can shorten the structural
life of the system; repetitive loads lead to seabed softening, reducing
the natural frequency of the structure close to the excitation
frequency. Most of the previous studies on degradation trained
prediction algorithms with actual sensor signals. However, there are no
actual sensor data on the dynamic response of OWTs over their lifespan
(approximately 20 years). In order to address this data issue, this
study proposes a new prediction platform combining a dynamic OWT model
and a neural network-based degradation prediction model. Specifically, a
virtual dynamic response was generated using a three-dimensional OWT and
a seabed finite element model. Then, the LSTM model was trained to
predict the natural frequency degradation using the dynamic response as
the model input. The results show that the developed model can
accurately predict natural frequencies over the next several years using
past and present accelerations and strains. In practice, this LSTM model
could be used to predict future natural frequencies using the dynamic
response of the structure, which can be measured using actual sensors
(accelerometers and strain gauges).

METHOD}\label{scaling-factor-estimation-by-the-mass-change-method}}

When natural input modal analysis is performed, the acting forces are
unknown; by this reason only un-scaled mode shapes may be obtained so
that the FRF matrix can not be constructed. If the structure is modified
and a new modal testing is carried out, the scaling factors can be
determined using the modal parameters (natural frequencies and mode
shapes) from both the modified and the unmodified structure. Mass change
is in many cases the simplest way to perform structural modification,
which involves repeated testing implying mass change in different points
of the structure where the mode shapes are known. In this paper, several
methods to estimate the scaling factors, based on the mass change
method, are presented. The accuracy obtained through the methods
proposed depends on the type of normalization used in the mode shapes,
the mass change magnitude and the number and the location of the masses
attached to the structure, which effect is also analyzed. Finally, it is
shown how the scaling factors can be used to improve the modal updating
procedures.

applying a search algorithm that looks for abrupt changes in more than

others, such parameters may be the means and location of excitation, the
density of the measurement point grid, the sampling rate and the length
of the time window. As an illustration, several examples of good and

Structures}\label{modal-based-fatigue-monitoring-of-steel-structures}}

In this paper it is shown how the accumulated fatigue in steel
structures can be estimated with high accuracy by continuously measuring
the accelerations in a few points of the structure. First step is to
obtain a good estimate of the mode shapes by performing a natural input
modal analysis. The so obtained mode shapes are then used to calibrate a
Finite Element model of the structure and to obtain the modal
coordinates of the active modes by inverting the mode shape matrix. If
the number of active modes is smaller than the number of measurement
points, then the problem is solved by regression. If the number of
active modes is larger then the number of measurement points, then the
number of active modes is reduced by band pass filtering. Once the modal
coordinates are identified and thus the complete response is established
in the modal domain, then the information is mapped to the physical
domain by applying the mode shapes of the calibrated Finite Element
model and strains are obtained using the shape functions for the actual
elements. The technique has been applied on a model frame structure in
the laboratory and on a wind loaded lattice pylon structure. In both
cases the estimated stresses has been compared with direct strain gauge
measurements and it appears that the difference between the strains
measured by strain gauges and the strains estimated by the presented
technique is quite small. Looking at the fatigue of the lattice pylon it
appears that the estimated damage is significantly smaller than the
damage forecasted by commonly accepted design rules. This points to
possibilities of significantly increasing the fatigue lives of
structures by performing continuous monitoring

Detecting damage in structural systems is often achieved by a
statistical comparison of damagesensitive characteristics of a structure
evaluated on baseline data, against the corresponding characteristics
obtained using data collected from a potentially defective structure.
While several vibration-based methods have been proposed and
successfully applied to detect damage in both mechanical and civil
structures over the past years, the general framework describing their
common properties and unifying the statistical decision about damage has
mainly been elaborated in the control community. In this paper, we
revise this framework in the context of detecting damage in structural
systems. The statistical properties of three commonly used damage
detection methods are recalled, and it is shown that their evaluation
for damage boils down to a simple statistical distance. The framework is
adopted to a commercial structural health monitoring software suite and
its practical merit is illustrated on damage detection of two full-scale
highway bridges.

(WT), and (3) a spatial domain approach based on Frequency Domain
Decomposition (FDD). The major focus of the damping estimation
approaches presented is on their capability in dealing with on-site
fullscale testing of engineering structures using ambient response
measurement. Computer simulations based on ambient response measurements
and modal identification of a 15-story office building and a
transmission tower were conducted to evaluate their performances of
different approaches in dealing with closely spaced modes and noisy
data. Major challenges in damping estimation are also discussed.

The results of an ambient-vibration based investigation conducted on a
historical tower in Italy, to update the 3-D finite element model of the
building are presented in this work. The main difficulties are related
to the extreme in-homogeneity of the building and the presence of an
elevator vain that occupies the posterior part of the tower, forcing to
locate the accelerometers only on one fac-ade of the building. The
assessment procedure include full-scale ambient vibration testing, modal
identification from ambient vibration responses using three different
identification methods, finite element modeling and dynamic-based
identification of the uncertain structural parameters of the model. A
very good match between theoretical and experimental modal parameters
was reached and the model updating has been performed to identify some
structural parameters.

\subsection{Case History Analysis of Bridge Failures due to
Scour}\label{case-history-analysis-of-bridge-failures-due-to-scour}}

Scour is a major cause for bridge failure. To understand the
characteristics of bridge failures under scour conditions and provide
useful information for scour countermeasure, this study reviewed and
analyzed totally 36 historical cases of bridge failure due to scour,
including their hydraulic, geotechnical, and structural conditions and
failure modes. Based on the collected data, most of scour depths
(i.e.~up to 41\%) ranged from 0.5 to 5 m; but, the maximum scour depth
could be up to 15 m. Local scour was accounted for 64\% bridge failures,
followed by channel migration (14\%), and contraction scour (5\%).
Possible bridge failure modes due to scour included vertical failure,
lateral failure, torsional failure, and bridge deck failure.
Approximately 70\% of bridge failures were lateral and vertical. The
findings from this study can be updated when more cases of bridge
failure under scour conditions are collected and/or become available.

\subsection{ANALYSIS OF RECENT BRIDGE FAILURES IN THE UNITED
STATES}\label{analysis-of-recent-bridge-failures-in-the-united-states}}

Over 500 failures of bridge structures in the United States between 1989
and 2000 were studied. The age of the failed bridges ranged from 1 year
(during construction) to 157 years, with an average of 52.5 years. The
most frequent causes of bridge failures were attributed to floods and
collisions. Flood and scour, with the major flood disaster in 1993,
contributed to the frequency peak of bridge failures (almost 53\% of all
failures). Bridge overload and lateral impact forces from trucks,
barges/ships, and trains constitute 20\% of the total bridge failures.
Other frequent principal causes are design, detailing, construction,
material, and maintenance. Comparison made among three periods of
similar studies (1977--1981, 1982--1988, and 1989--2000) revealed almost
similar trends, with most failures occurring during the bridge's service
life. Also, human-induced external events occurred frequently in all
three periods, but were most dominant in the first and third periods.
