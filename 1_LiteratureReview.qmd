## Shen-Haw Ju (2013)

### Main Findings

The trend of the frequency decreases with the increase of the scour depth.

### Summary

This paper **developed a finite element method with the effect of soil–fluid–structure interaction to calculate bridge natural frequencies**. It **validated that the natural frequencies calculated using the proposed finite element method had acceptable accuracy**. The **frequency change due to the fluid effect is not obvious**, but the changes in natural frequency with the scour depth are more obvious when the scour depth is such that pile cap is exposed.

### Measurements

• 1st natural frequency in each direction

• the natural frequencies calculated using the proposed finite element method

## Zarafshan et al. (2012)

### Main Findings
• A new and simple type of scour sensor has been developed, tested, and implemented in the field.

• The sensor uses a single fiber-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for transduction of the vibration frequency. 

• A computational approach has been developed based on the Winkler spring reaction soil model for automated calibration of the scour sensor during installation in the riverbed.

### Summary

This paper describes the development and testing of a new type of scour sensor that is based on measuring the fundamental frequency of vibration of a rod embedded in the riverbed. The sensor uses a single fiber-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for transduction of the vibration frequency. The inverse relationship between the fundamental frequency and the length of the sensor rod is used for detection of the scour depth.
### Measurements

## Zarafshan et al. (2012)

### Main Findings

• The natural frequencies of the NREL 5MW monopile-supported offshore wind turbine (OWT) decrease with increasing scour depth around the foundation. 

• Soil density and scour hole depth have a significant influence on the obtained natural frequencies. 

• Accelerations were extracted at nine locations along the tower resulting from applied wind and wave loads.

### Summary

This paper studies the **change in the natural frequencies of the NREL 5MW monopile-supported offshore wind turbine (OWT) due to scour**. It uses the **OpenFAST and SESAM software** to model the wind turbine and consider soil-structure interaction. It is shown that the **increase in scour depth around the foundation of the OWT leads to a decrease in natural frequencies**.

### Measurements

A model of the wind turbine was developed using OpenFAST and SESAM software which considers aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading with soil structure interaction

Accelerations are extracted at nine locations along the tower resulting from applied wind and wave loads. The first two system natural frequencies are estimated using frequency domain decomposition (FDD) applied to the acceleration time-histories for each scour depth and soil type.

## Yun-Ho Seo, M. Ryu, Ki‐Yong Oh (2020)

### Main Findings

The stiffness of the suction bucket cap and strain dependency of the soil play a significant role in predicting natural frequency, suggesting that these two factors should be considered in finite element analysis for the accurate prediction of dynamic responses of an offshore wind conversion system.

Dynamic analysis of the strain and acceleration measured during operational conditions shows that strain is more robust than acceleration with regard to the characterization of the overall dynamics of an offshore wind conversion system because the natural frequency of an offshore wind turbine is very low.

It can be inferred that the measurement of strain is a more effective way to monitor the long-term evolution of dynamic characteristics.

The suggested integrated framework and measurement campaign are useful not only to avoid conservatism that may incur additional costs during load calculation and design phases but also to establish an intelligent operation and maintenance strategy with a novel sensing technique.

### Summary

to investigate the dynamic characteristics of an offshore wind turbine with tripod suction buckets through finite element analysis and full scale experiments

The measurement of strain is a more effective way to monitor the long-term evolution of dynamic characteristics of an offshore wind conversion system.

### Main Findings

Beneficial effects from densification of sand and consolidation in the clay lead to stiffness increases – the effect of these increases on the natural frequency of the offshore wind turbine needs to be considered in design.


The rate of accumulation in caisson rotation is observed to be the same from centrifuge and single gravity tests, while the initial rotation differs with stress level, drainage regime, loading magnitude, soil profile and installation method.

Application of this calculation approach to field conditions showed that the long-term rotation for one-way loading would be higher for a sand over clay seabed than for a sand seabed.


### Summary

The centrifuge tests model the correct soil self-weight stress levels, installation process and drainage response but could only test on the order of 10000 cycles.
