<p>This paper <strong>developed a finite element method with the effect of soil–fluid–structure interaction to calculate bridge natural frequencies</strong>. It <strong>validated that the natural frequencies calculated using the proposed finite element method had acceptable accuracy</strong>. The <strong>frequency change due to the fluid effect is not obvious</strong>, but the changes in natural frequency with the scour depth are more obvious when the scour depth is such that pile cap is exposed.</p>
<p>The trend of the frequency decreases with the increase of the scour depth.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the <strong>use of a vibration-based method to monitor scour</strong> and the <strong>effect of scour on the natural frequency of an offshore wind turbine</strong>. It finds that <strong>wind turbines founded in loose sand would exhibit the largest relative reductions in natural frequency resulting from scour</strong>.</p>
<p>• Scour can reduce the ultimate capacity and alter the dynamic response of offshore wind turbine foundations.</p>
<p>• A vibration-based method can be used to monitor scour.</p>
<p>• Wind turbines founded in loose sand would experience the largest relative reductions in natural frequency due to scour.</p>
<p>The development of offshore wind energy converters is viewed as one of the most cost effective and politically acceptable short-term means of reducing society’s reliance on fossil fuels. Since 1991, the majority (over 75%) of offshore wind turbines have been founded on large diameter steel tubular monopiles (EWEA, 2012) .</p>

<p>This paper describes the development and testing of a new type of scour sensor that is based on measuring the fundamental frequency of vibration of a rod embedded in the riverbed. The sensor uses a single fiber-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for transduction of the vibration frequency. The inverse relationship between the fundamental frequency and the length of the sensor rod is used for detection of the scour depth.</p>
<p>• A new and simple type of scour sensor has been developed, tested, and implemented in the field.</p>
<p>• The sensor uses a single fiber-optic Bragg grating (FBG) sensor for transduction of the vibration frequency.</p>
<p>• A computational approach has been developed based on the Winkler spring reaction soil model for automated calibration of the scour sensor during installation in the riverbed.</p>

<p>This paper describes a centrifuge-testing programme to establish the <strong>sensitivity of bridge natural frequency to scour</strong>. It found that the <strong>level of frequency sensitivity is high</strong>, demonstrating the potential for using natural frequency as an indicator of both local and global scour of bridges.</p>
<p>• Tests found up to a 40% variation in natural frequency for 30% loss of embedment for a two-span integral bridge with 15 m spans.</p>
<p>• Shallow foundation models showed lower frequency sensitivity to scour than deep foundation models.</p>
<p>• Frequency sensitivity to “global scour” is slightly higher than the sensitivity to “local scour”, for all foundation types.</p>
<p>Bridge scour refers to the removal of soil from around structural foundations located in a river or coastal region as a result of the erosive action of water [1] .</p>
<p>Scour around a bridge foundation leads to a reduction in bridge stiffness and stability because of the loss of embedment, which can even lead to bridge failure. According to historical bridge failure surveys, more than 50% of bridge failures have primarily been the result of scour-related causes [2,3].</p>

<p>This paper studies the <strong>change in the natural frequencies of the NREL 5MW monopile-supported offshore wind turbine (OWT) due to scour</strong>. It uses the <strong>OpenFAST and SESAM software</strong> to model the wind turbine and consider soil-structure interaction.

<p>• The natural frequencies of the NREL 5MW monopile-supported offshore wind turbine (OWT) decrease with increasing scour depth around the foundation.</p>
<p>• Soil density and scour hole depth have a significant influence on the obtained natural frequencies.</p>
<p>• Accelerations were extracted at nine locations along the tower resulting from applied wind and wave loads.</p>
<p>A model of the wind turbine was developed using OpenFAST and SESAM software which considers aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loading with soil structure interaction</p>
<p>Accelerations are extracted at nine locations along the tower resulting from applied wind and wave loads. The first two system natural frequencies are estimated using frequency domain decomposition (FDD) applied to the acceleration time-histories for each scour depth and soil type.</p>

<p>The yield moment for the tripod foundation was half that of the monopod.</p>
<p>When the resultant moment of cyclic loading was smaller than the monotonic yield moment, negligible accumulated plastic deformation was observed for both one-way and two-way loading.

<p>The stiffness of the suction bucket cap and strain dependency of the soil play a significant role in predicting natural frequency, suggesting that these two factors should be considered in finite element analysis for the accurate prediction of dynamic responses of an offshore wind conversion system.</p>
<p>Dynamic analysis of the strain and acceleration measured during operational conditions shows that strain is more robust than acceleration with regard to the characterization of the overall dynamics of an offshore wind conversion system because the natural frequency of an offshore wind turbine is very low.</p>
<p>It can be inferred that the measurement of strain is a more effective way to monitor the long-term evolution of dynamic characteristics.</p>
<p>The suggested integrated framework and measurement campaign are useful not only to avoid conservatism that may incur additional costs during load calculation and design phases but also to establish an intelligent operation and maintenance strategy with a novel sensing technique.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the **effect of scour on the natural frequency responses of bridge piers**. It develops a **scour depth sensor** and conducts extensive laboratory tests in both dry sand and a soft clayey soil. Finally, an equivalent cantilever model is proposed to correlate the variation of the frequency of the sensor to the scour depth.</p>
<p>• Extensive laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the effect of the geometry and material of the sensor, the effect of the embedded length and the effect of soil type on the natural frequency responses of bridge piers.</p>
<p>• A numerical 3D finite-element model was developed and compared against experimental data to evaluate the effect of immersed conditions on the sensor’s response.</p>

<p>Scour is considered as the main cause of bridge damages [1] and accounts for nearly half of all bridge collapses in the USA [2].

<p>This paper presents an analytical model of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) supported on flexible foundation. The model uses a <strong>Timoshenko beam model</strong> and <strong>three springs</strong> to predict the natural frequency of the OWTs. The results show that the model predicts the natural frequency of existing turbines with reasonable accuracy.</p>
<p>• The Timoshenko beam model does not improve the results significantly and the slender beam assumption may be sufficient.</p>
<p>• The cross-coupling spring term has a significant effect on the natural frequency and needs to be included in the analysis.</p>
<p>• The model predicts the natural frequency of existing turbines with reasonable accuracy.</p>
<p>OWTs must be designed to avoid the frequency range of the forcing (wind turbulence and water wave spectra) and also the rotational frequency (1P) and the blade passing frequency (3P for a three-bladed turbine) ranges of the turbine. The importance of dynamics for offshore wind turbines is well established in the literature ( [1]- [5]) &nbsp; <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3a89e231dbdcfa18d599ddcdae6c308e1f9cc4c0">Another paper</a>&nbsp;said:</p>

<p>• This paper presents a compendium of mathematical expressions to compute the natural frequencies of offshore wind turbine (OWT) structures on various foundation types.</p>
<p>• The calculations presented can be easily made using spreadsheets.</p>
<p>• Example calculations are provided to compare the compiled solutions against publicly available sources.</p>
<p>Typically costing 16-34% of the total cost of a wind farm project, the foundation system becomes a controlling factor [1]. The choice of a foundation in turn depends on factors such as the water depth, fabrication, installation, operation and maintenance, decommissioning, and economics</p>

<p>The scour risk assessment was conducted for ultimate limit state of newly developed penta pod suction bucket support structures for a 5.5 MW offshore wind turbine. The hazard was found by using an empirical formula for scour depth suitable for considering marine environmental conditions such as significant wave height, significant wave period, and current velocity. The scour fragility curve was calculated by using allowable bearing capacity criteria of suction foundation. The scour risk was assessed by combining the scour hazard and the scour fragility.</p>

<p>This paper explores the <strong>civil engineering problems encountered for offshore wind turbines</strong>. It reviews previous work on the design of offshore foundations and presents some simple design calculations for sizing foundations and structures appropriate to the wind-turbine problem.</p>
<p>• Offshore wind turbines are a viable alternative to onshore wind farms, as they can provide more energy and are less likely to be objected to on aesthetic grounds.</p>
<p>• The design of offshore foundations is a critical component of the engineering challenge, and current designs have deficiencies that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>• Research is currently underway to improve designs so that offshore wind turbines can compete economically with traditional energy suppliers.</p>

<p>For a review of the different foundation solutions see Byrne and Houlsby (2003). Gravity base foundations generally require substantial seabed preparations and where scour protection is installed below the level of the surrounding seabed there is the potential for sediment accretion changing what are potential hard substrates to silty/sandy seabeds and the possible accumulation of decaying macro-algae and the development of elevated nutrient levels. Therefore, the effects of sediment smothering, sediment accretion and scouring may lead to a corresponding reduction in benthic recruitment success, etc. The aim of the current paper is to evaluate the development of scour on the seabed from an analysis of monitoring results of data from built offshore windfarms, supplemented with reference to other published datasets. The sensitivity of a range of different seabed sediment environments to the physical process of scour is assessed. Knowledge of the scour that has developed to date around offshore windfarm foundations supplements the existing guidance available from Det Norske Veritas (DNV) (2007) and is also informative for other offshore renewable technologies.</p>

<p>• Vertical loading can decrease pile lateral displacement and improve the lateral capacity of piles in the absence of scour and under scour.</p>

<p>• Seepage effect is limited in silt, and the suction required to penetrate the caisson can be predicted based on the sleeve friction and cone resistance of cone penetration tests.</p>

<p>This paper compares <strong>field and laboratory tests of caisson foundations in sand and clay</strong>. It finds that the <strong>laboratory data from moment loading tests were similar to the field data in most cases</strong>, but the <strong>laboratory and field data from vertically loaded caisson tests show more significant differences</strong>.</p>
<p>• Laboratory tests applying vertical and moment loads to suction caissons founded in sand and clay were conducted to simulate an equivalent series of field tests.</p>
<p>• The non-dimensional laboratory data from moment loading tests were similar to the field data in most cases.</p>
<p>• The non-dimensional data from vertically loaded caisson tests in the laboratory and in the field show more significant differences.</p>
<p>Suction caissons have been used to provide innovative solutions to deep-water foundation and anchoring problems during the last 15 to 20 years. For some of these projects, programmes of model testing designed to simulate prototype caisson behaviour have been conducted. Laboratory studies of small-scale model caissons at 1g include Larsen (1989), Steensen-Bach (1992) and El-Gharbawy &amp; Olson (1998), whereas centrifuge studies were carried out by Watson et al.&nbsp;(2000), Bang et al.&nbsp;(2001), House &amp; Randolph (2001) and Clukey et al.&nbsp;(2003). Published data from field trials using larger-scale caissons are less common, but include Hogervorst (1980), Tjelta (1986), Dyvik et al.&nbsp;(1993) and Cho et al.&nbsp;(2003). In most of these studies, the data are used to calibrate theoretical models, which are then used to predict prototype behaviour. No attempt has been made to compare directly the load-displacement response of caissons at different scales. Such comparisons are, however, vital if model testing is to be used to predict field behaviour.</p>

<p>• A novel numerical technique, the scaled boundary finite element method, is used to calculate stiffness coefficients for caisson foundations embedded in nonhomogeneous elastic soil.</p>
<p>• The stiffness coefficients take into account the possibility of nonhomogeneity in the soil, the geometry of the foundation, and the contribution to the stiffness of the skirt of the caisson foundation.</p>
<p>• Tabulated values allow a simple curve fit to the stiffness values to be employed for particular cases.</p>

<p>This paper discusses the <strong>effects of scour on the design of offshore wind turbines</strong>. It describes how scour can affect the <strong>foundation length and stiffness, natural frequency, and fatigue variation</strong> of a turbine. The paper concludes that scour can have a significant impact on the design of offshore wind turbines.</p>
<p>• Offshore structures on a sandy seabed are susceptible to scour, which affects the required foundation length and stiffness, has an effect on the structure’s natural frequency and may cause free-spanning of the J-tubes.</p>
<p>• Varying the scour depth from 0 to 13m does require more steel (longer pile) but does not seriously affect the dynamics and fatigue of the structure in this case.</p>
<p>• Care should be taken to avoid direct interference between natural and excitation frequencies, reducing the risk of large dynamic amplification and unwanted exponential increase of fatigue.</p>

<p>This paper presents a procedure for the coupled dynamic analysis of offshore wind turbine–jacket foundation-suction bucket piles and compares the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard method and Jeanjean’s methods used to model the piles. Nonlinear springs were used to represent soil lateral, axial, and tip resistances through the P–Y, T–Z, and Q–Z curves obtained by either API’s or Jeanjean’s methods. Rotational springs with a stiffness equated to the tangent or secant modulus characterized soil resistance to acentric loads. The procedure was implemented in X-SEA program. Analyses of a laterally loaded single pile in a soft clay soil performed in both the X-SEA and Structural Analysis Computer System (SACS) programs showed good agreements. The behaviors of a five MW offshore wind turbine system in South Korea were examined by considering waves, current, wind effects, and marine growth. In a free vibration analysis done with soil stiffness through the API method, the piles were found to bend in their first mode and to twist in the second and third modes, whereas the first three modes using Jeanjean’s method were all found to twist. The natural frequencies resulting from Jeanjean’s method were higher than those from the API method. In a forced vibration analysis, the system responses were significantly influenced by soil spring stiffness type. The procedure was found to be computationally expensive due to spring nonlinearities introduced.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the <strong>impact of local and global scour erosion on the monotonic lateral response of a monopile in sand</strong>. It uses centrifuge tests to assess the effect of scour on the performance of piles with low L/D. Results suggest that <strong>scour has a significant impact on the lateral load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the pile</strong>.</p>
<p>• Scour has a significant impact on the lateral load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the pile, leading to increases in bending moment magnitude along the pile shaft and lowering the location of peak pile bending moment.</p>
<p>• The response varies with scour type, with global scour resulting in larger moments than local scour.</p>
<p>• The size of the local scour hole is found to have a significant impact on the pile response, suggesting that scour hole width should be explicitly considered in design.</p>
