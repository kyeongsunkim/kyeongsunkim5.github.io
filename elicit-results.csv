3D FE dynamic modelling of offshore wind turbines in sand: natural frequency evolution in the pre– to after-storm transition,The original offshore wind turbine natural frequency seems to be restored as a consequence of post-storm re-consolidation.,"E.

For this purpose, the well-known SANISAND04 bounding surface plasticity model (Dafalias a Manzari 2004) is adopted in this work to incorporate key aspects of critical state soil mechanics into the analysis of monopile foundations in sand. The final 3D soil-foundation-OWT model is exploited to simulate the response of an 8 MW OWT to a long loading history of approximately 2 hours duration. The scope is to investigate/explain the drops in natural frequency observed in the field during storms, as well as its subsequent recovery. The numerical results point out a strong connection between transient frequency drops and pore pressure accumulation, whereas the original OWT natural frequency seems to be restored as a consequence of post-storm re-consolidation.",,,,,,"This paper uses **3D non-linear finite element analyses** to study the **foundations of offshore wind turbines**.

Natural Frequency and Damping Estimation of an Offshore Wind Turbine Structure,The computational first natural bending frequency of the structure and the contribution of soil damping are compared with experimental results.,"M. Damgaard, Jacob Karottki Falk Andersen, L. B. Ibsen, L. Andersen",,,,,,2012,49,,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f2d45c53c24d15300a1a889b5693c81faf91199a,"During the last years, offshore wind turbines have increased significantly in size with larger rotors and more powerful generators. The costs are kept as low as possible by reducing the overall weight, which leads to very slender and flexible structures. An improper design may cause resonance due to the excitation from wind and waves, leading to immature failure in the fatigue limit state. This in turn necessitates a correct estimate of the basic dynamic properties of the entire wind turbine structure. The paper presents experimental investigations of the first natural bending frequency and damping ratio of an offshore wind turbine located in the North Sea. Simple Fourier Transformation and least square fitting to the vibration decay of ten “rotor stop” tests make it possible to evaluate the dynamic properties of the wind turbine structure. Based on the traditionally p-y curve method (Winkler type approach), a numerical modal analysis of the wind turbine structure is conducted in order to compare the computational first natural bending frequency of the structure and the contribution of soil damping with experimental results.",,,,,The population is in the North Sea,This paper presents **experimental investigations of the first natural bending frequency and damping ratio of an offshore wind turbine**.

Natural frequency of offshore wind turbines on rigid and flexible monopiles in cohesionless soils with linear stiffness distribution,A simplified method is introduced to obtain the fundamental frequency of offshore wind turbines supported by monopile foundations.,"Saeed  Darvishi-Alamouti, Mohammad-Reza  Bahaari, Majid  Moradi",,,,10.1016/J.APOR.2017.07.009,,2017,20,https://doi.org/10.1016/J.APOR.2017.07.009,https://semanticscholar.org/paper/18a082c971c8f6e44718c41391b0e0be57481727,"Abstract A simplified method is introduced to obtain the fundamental frequency of offshore wind turbines supported by monopile foundations. Soil-pile interaction is modeled based on Winkler approach and concept of beam on elastic foundation. The soil is considered to have linearly varying modulus of subgrade reaction along depth which is a typical assumption for cohesionless soils. Rayleigh method which is based on conservation of total energy of the system is utilized. Firstly the natural frequency of the system with rigid pile is derived and then an innovative procedure is introduced to take pile flexural stiffness into consideration. Comparison between results of the present method with those of a numerical FE model for a typical 2 MW wind turbine structure shows excellent agreement for rigid pile and flexible pile with small value of slenderness ratio. The agreement is also good for flexible pile with higher slenderness ratios. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the effect of important parameters of foundation including pile slenderness ratio, pile aspect ratio and pile mass on the system natural frequency.",,,,,,"This paper introduces a simplified method to obtain the fundamental frequency of offshore wind turbines supported by monopile foundations.

A variety of both environmental conditions and wind turbine control schemes are tested. A maximum power control strategy is applied for wind velocities below the rated wind speed for the wind turbine, while a constant power control strategy is achieved by controlling the rotor blade pitch for wind velocities above rated wind speed. Conventional rotor blade pitch control for wind velocities above rated wind speed introduces negative damping of the tower motion. This results in excitation of the natural frequency in pitch for the tower and may lead to unacceptable tower motions. Active damping of the undesirable tower motions is obtained by an additional pitch control algorithm based on measurement of the tower velocity.Copyright © 2006 by ASME",,,,,2 different simulation models for integrated dynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines,"This paper describes and compares **two different simulation models for integrated dynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines**.
